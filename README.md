# 🍳 SmartCookery – Your Recipe Finder

**SmartCookery** is a simple and interactive recipe-finding web application that helps users discover recipes from a pre-defined local collection. It is designed to be minimal, responsive, and beginner-friendly, making it easy to navigate and explore.

## 📌 About the Project
This project was created as a **practice application** after I learned the fundamentals of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The main goal was to apply my newly acquired skills by building a functional project that includes search functionality, local data handling, and page navigation.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Recipes are stored locally in a JavaScript data file.
- Users can search for a recipe by name or keyword.
- JavaScript filters through the local dataset and displays matching recipes.
- Clicking on a recipe navigates the user to its dedicated detail page with instructions.

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was built to:
- Practice working with local data in JavaScript.
- Improve DOM manipulation and event handling skills.
- Learn how to create multi-page navigation using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Build a responsive and user-friendly interface without using any external APIs or libraries.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Structure and layout.
- **CSS** – Styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript** – Functionality, search logic, and navigation.
